            Understanding Learning management system (LMS)?</h3>
        <p class="font-medium text-[18px] leading-[28px]">An LMS is a platform used by organizations and educational
            institutions
            to manage, track, and deliver
            learning experiences. It centralizes training, assessments, and content delivery, making it ideal for
            corporate learning, compliance training, employee development, and academic courses. By automating
            administrative tasks and offering interactive learning experiences, an LMS helps foster growth,
            development, and compliance, all from a single system tailored to the needs of businesses and schools
            alike.</p>
