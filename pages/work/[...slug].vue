        Piramal Foundation for Education Leadership is the philanthropic arm of
        the Piramal Group. The foundation undertakes projects under the four
        broad areas – healthcare, education, livelihood creation and youth
        empowerment. These projects are rolled out in partnership with various
        communities, corporate citizens, NGOs and government bodies.
      </p>
      <div class="mb-6">
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Challenge</h1>
        <p>
          Piramal Foundation for Education Leadership wanted to create a
          future-ready, exhaustive digital platform which effectively executes
          their large-scale social impact program called ‘Gandhi Fellowship’ by
          taking a values-driven approach to the learning goals using various
          value domains that govern the learner’s growth.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          Each value domain was to be tracked with competencies that would have
          more than 1000 sub-sub-competencies leading to specialization and
          segregation of learning activities. The learning platform had to guide
          a learner through an increased level of awareness and competence in
          each of the domains incrementally.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          It required a gamified and assisted learning experience for the
          learners and the capacity to track every learner for their chosen
          Aspiration Path on predefined criteria and the power to choose and
          realign their career goals. It had to allow rapid content authoring of
          digital content and engineer a way to help, support, and motivate the
          learners during their growth and capable to provide a mobile
          app-driven online & offline, multilingual learning delivery and had to
          integrate with other systems; employed already or that will be
          employed in future.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-6">
        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Solution</h1>
        <p>
          Using a multi-disciplinary design optimization approach Edvanta
          created a competency and value framework that drives the entire
          learning journey and helps learners on their paths to achieve their
          chosen predefined aspirational paths with a compliance-driven student
          induction and training methodologies implementation approach.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          We created a highly interactive learning experience gamified through
          incentive centred design using badges, simulations and rewards with
          offline access of rich learning content, including H5P offline which
          was custom developed for this project.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          The system features an in-built rapid content authoring toolkit that
          can record and download transcripts of objectives met in a learning
          activity.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          It has a peer-manager assisted workshop driven assessment system which
          was developed to promote collective understanding of the numerous
          social issues where the assessments would happen amongst the group of
          peers as well as program leaders and managers by digitizing their
          integral feedback model which allows a user to be reviewed/assessed by
          themselves, peers, program leaders, and other stakeholders on a
          structured metric and a grading model which allows grading on the
          basis of proficiency in a skill, practiced on-field or online.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          The platform was integrated with Office 365 to help provide a seamless
          user experience, as it supports interoperability of not only learning
          modules, content and courses but even integrates with any identity
          management system (like Office 365 HRMS, Drupal, Ticketing System,
          etc).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          A learner journal facility was employed that tracks the understanding,
          opinion and emotional states of the learner helping him reflect on the
          key issues he/she is dealing with and allows them to add documents,
          pictures, videos, etc to these journals.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          The platform also has a grievance management system built in, with an
          alarm/emergency call/contact system where the learner can be tracked
          if he/she has lost contact, using governed rules pre-set in the
          system.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          Keeping in mind that this is a large-scale social impact program, the
          system facilitates the creation of an Alumni Management System, which
          will be implemented in the future. The system currently facilitates a
          bilingual learning capability (English and Hindi) with a capacity of
          Multilingual learning capabilities which will be used in the near
          future.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Result</h1>
        <p>
          As technology vendor cum strategic partner, Edvanta helped Piramal
          Foundation for Education Leadership to architect, build and support a
          Totara driven learning ecosystem; which in turn uplifts and augments
          the Gandhi Fellowship experience to build the next generation of
          leaders, evangelists and social entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          The technology solution aids the fellowship program learning
          experience for over 400 fellows in one of the cohorts; spread across
          20 states in India; thereby laying a foundation for the next
          generation of fellows who will set out to impact one million lives.
        </p>

        </ul>
        <p class="mt-5">
          While these changes would start to show gradually; the PFEL learning
          ecosystem implementation was able to communicate the benefits and
          user-friendliness of their brand through the Totara learning platform.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          The PFEL learning ecosystem now supports the fellows in their journey
          of personal growth and social impact. With a clear map of
          opportunities, skill and cognitive attitude, the application is going
          to serve the aspiration paths of the fellows and is thus named as
          MAP(My Aspiration Path) Mobile App.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          The PFEL’s mission is to educate and transform education in India; the
          Totara Learn implementation is instrumental in this change and is the
          sine qua non of their learning ecosystem.
